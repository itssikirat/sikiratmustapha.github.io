        </p>
        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-raleway u-text u-text-2">As a Global Markets Analyst at Goldman Sachs, I rotated between the Prime Brokerage &amp; Futures Sales and the Equity Franchise Sales desks to learn about the ​respective businesses, provide investment research, analysis, and opportunities for hedge fund and institutional clients, and to pitch new IPOs to enhance client portfolio hedging and returns.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Consequently, I researched contemporary market trends and compared them to client portfolios, analyzed financial statements and quarterly earnings to discern equities investments. In a COVID environment, however, it was difficult to target how clients could select investments that would both weather prevailing market volatility and yield high returns.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Thus, I worked with the risk division to conduct a portfolio “pressure” test against prevailing and upcoming trends to discern how a client’s portfolio would react. Based on those findings, I selected stocks that would enable growth independent of these situations. Ultimately, this idea helped me to garner the “Best Stock Pitch” award for my Shopify pitch and the US Equity Franchise Sales team opted to use my methodology with investments going forward. Further, I outlined Shopify’s powering of global e-commerce&nbsp; to drive investors towards the market for future investments. Take a look at some of the work below!<br>

        <p class="u-custom-font u-font-raleway u-text u-text-2"> Think of some of your favorite companies. Whether its “billionaire” Kylie Jenner’s cosmetics company, Kylie Cosmetics, the famous workwear brand Gymshark, or the consumer brand that seemingly owns everything, Pepsi, they all converge at one point…Shopify.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Shopify is an e-commerce platform that enables merchants from aspirational, small entrepreneurs to large enterprises to commercialize their products via a monthly subscription fee, and additional services provided by the platform.&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Overview</b>
          <br>- Starting in 2004 as an online vendor for snowboard gear, Shopify has clearly grown tremendously from its early stages.&nbsp;<br>- Now it boasts over 1 million business on the platform driving 140 billions dollars in sales<br>- In just three months, it’s share price has experienced some of the highest growth in 2020 with a &nbsp;174%increase &nbsp;<br>- And it possesses one of the &nbsp;largest TAMs within software at 200 billion dollars globally&nbsp;<br>- Such a large TAM precipitates the valuation for 12 month investment target of $1286 per share&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Key Drivers</b>
          <br>This projection is due to 4 key drivers:<br>- The expansion of the global e-commerce market&nbsp;<br>- The growth of its proprietary services &nbsp;<br>- Its convincing horizon for international penetration<br>- Its projected increase in Unit Economics and Scale&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Global Ecommerce</b>
          <br>- The global eccomerce markets has already been swelling but with COVID-19 in the mix that expansion has accelerated<br>- With one of the largest TAMs in software yet a pretty small GMV of 2.4%, Shopify is well positioned and is projected to have GMV growth 36% yoy as it develops its proprietary services one of which being its subscription solutions.&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Subscription Solutions</b>
          <br>- This is Shopify’s recurring software revenue that is being incurred from the various subscriptions<br>- Shopify’s general subscription plans range from ~360 to ~3600 per year. Assuming an average ARPC of 1000 per year for customers under 500k yearly revenue creates a US Tam of 17 bn for subscription solutions<br>- For Shopify Plus, which has pricing starting at 24k per year but once merchants reach 800k in sales per month, Shopify actually takes .25% of total revenue which enables Shopify to participate in the growth much larger merchants like the Kiths, Pepsis, and Kylie Cosmetics&nbsp;<br>- I estimate Shopify Plus would fit about 30% of B2C merchants with over 500k in sales and their respective ARPCs, this creates a projected US Tam of 45 billion and when adding the additional global data we have that projected Tam of 100 billion <br>- This opens a world of opportunity considering subscription solutions generated 642 million in 2019 a 38% increase from 2018 and in 2020, subscriptions solutions increased 34% in Q1 to 187.6 million and 28% in Q2 to 196.4 million primarily driven by the increase 21% increase in Monthly Recurring Revenue as June saw &nbsp;the largest number of merchants EVER in a single month subscribing to shopify plus<br>- Incredible q2 earnings show that&nbsp;June was the largest number of single month&nbsp;subscription in&nbsp;Shopify Plus. And its other&nbsp;proprietary service, merchant solutions, has an even larger growth&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Merchant solutions</b>
          <br>- It currently has a low take rate of just 1.6% but&nbsp;It’s projected that a mid-tier “fully loaded” merchant would create &nbsp;~6% take rate&nbsp;<br>- And just like subscription solutions, we are seeing promising q2 results:&nbsp;<br>- Q2&nbsp;saw a 119% increase in YoY GMV which will drive take rate upwards&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Shopify’s Fulliment Network Would add an incremental 15% to the take rate because of its ultimate increase in sales conversion. This stems from the enablement of smaller merchants to access low cost and fast shipping options to more quickly become paid customers for the platform&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Future of International Expansion</b>
          <br>- The growth of these proprietary services are exponentially increase when we consider&nbsp;international&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;<br>- To put things in perspective, international represent ~75% of global GMV while international only represents 29% of SHOPs merchant base<br>Closing this gap will provide a lot of&nbsp;opportunity. By 2023, the international to us ratio is projected to be nearly 50:50&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Unit Economics</b>
          <br>- And for all of those new customers, as shopify builds in international customer base, improves its take rates, and builds out its proprietary&nbsp;services to onboard more clients to&nbsp;Shopify&nbsp;Plus, shopify will&nbsp;increase customer lifetime value to customer&nbsp;acquisition cost &nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Valuation</b>
          <br>- Yes,&nbsp;shopify is expensive&nbsp;but&nbsp;research&nbsp;analyst Merwin &nbsp;thinks that this is justified because of its unmatched projected&nbsp;addressable&nbsp;market<br>- Shopify is currently trading at 38 times EV/Sales relative to the average 25 times it’s peers for 2021&nbsp;<br>- Our base case DCF assumes a 20-year sales CAGR of 13% for subscription solutions, 22% for Merchant solutions and EBIT margin of 32% by FY40.&nbsp;<br>- This implies a DCF valuation of $1286 share based on a 50/50 weighting of EV sales. 47x/36x our CY21/22 sales estimate and 42x/30x our CY21/22 Blue Sky estimate (see Blue Sky scenario below). While we think the recent run-up in SHOP shares has already started to price in some of the realities around the recent step-function change in e-commerce penetration, among other factors, we believe SHOP is well positioned to continue beating and raising estimates, which should drive continue stock outperformance over the next 12 months.<br>- When adjusted for its lower gross margin, its EV/Gross Profit is 73x vs. 34x of its peers&nbsp;indicating&nbsp; much higher&nbsp;net worth&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Even with these comparisons, the <b>lack of disruptive competitors </b>to challenge shopify makes it even more valuable.&nbsp;<br>- There just are no other platforms that provide the full suite of service that Shopify does for merchants.&nbsp;<br>- However, even when comparing firms that having competition individual propreietary services, Shopify still excels&nbsp;<br>- At a high-level, Shopify’s strategic partnerships with with companies like Stripe to enable payments, logistics providers like USPS and UPS for shipping labels, financial institutions for Shopify capital for lending, with Walmart, as a variety of other applications and marketplaces provides merchants with unmatched ecommerce enablements services and a source of aggregated demand<br>
          <br><b>GCA Value</b>
          <br>-Given these projections, it is understandable that investors would want to check in with management providing excellent value for GS<br>- Relatively, there are good number notable hedge funds like t.&nbsp;Rowe price and vanguard which, because of their high trading volume and consistency, will prove to be an incredible value add for Goldman&nbsp;<br>- And skewed saturation in U.S. markets further&nbsp;solidifies international opportunities<br>- Despite&nbsp;all&nbsp;of these upsides there a few, minute risks&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Risks<br></b>1.) Lower than expected growth of merchant particularly for Shopify Plus could lead to lower top and bottom line estimates<br>2.) Lower than expected adoption of merchant solutions could also lead to a lower top and bottom line&nbsp;<br>3.) Longterm lockdowns could impact consumer spending drive down Shopify churn rate&nbsp;<br>4.) Multiple Risk: These are high multiples execution problems investor&nbsp;rotation&nbsp;out of high multiple stocks could negatively impact Shopify&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Summary</b>
          <br>The growth of global ecommerce, its proprietary services, it’s&nbsp;International&nbsp;client base, as well it’s unit economics will drive shopify to meet and potentially exceed its price target.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Thus, the time is now to Shop for Shopify
