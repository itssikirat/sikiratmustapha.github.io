      <p style="color: #ffffff"> I'm Tyrese Thomas, a junior at Columbia studying sociology and east asian studies. My love for entrepreneurship coupled with my lust for understanding people and societies has engendered my passion for innovation and disruption. Consequently, I have worked in many industries to get a better sense of how innovation manifests across seemingly disparate realms. Additionally, my diverse background has fostered my dedication to positively impacting marginalized communities through impact investing and non-profit work. Ultimately, I seek to be a founder, businessman, and a thought-leader in the realms of fashion and retail, law, and social entrepreneurship. </p>
